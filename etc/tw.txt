2022-03-20T16:40:09+01:00	hello twtxt!!! tweeting with https://git.sr.ht/~noizhardware/twBao, still a work in progress :))
2022-03-20T22:50:19+01:00	now twtxting from my netbook, on Lubuntu uiiii it works!
2022-03-21T00:15:18+01:00	will have to implement some curl scanning for follows and mentions. gona be a nice chance to brush up my C-string-fu LoL
2022-03-21T11:40:51+01:00	funny how a stack-based machine might actually be a welcoming environment for functional reactive programming #frp #coding #raven #666cpu
2022-03-21T20:39:14+01:00	LWave : system to generate a #1bit or #8bit audio stream with L-Systems (might have an interactive/livecoding part) #sound #coding #livecoding #nyx #halfbaked
2022-03-22T00:54:15+01:00	twtxting from Android(Termux) uiiiiii!
2022-03-22T09:52:33+01:00	started adding follows, decided to keep my list in the header here, hope it helps with discoverability and making new connections :)) #twtxt #community
2022-03-22T15:34:38+01:00	idea: using a #matrixmixer to generate feedback exciting membranes with a piezo. Try an irish drum #minijack #video #sound
2022-03-25T13:07:36+01:00	#live #music idea: revived devices used as instruments, #sound coming from their own speakers. #livecoding #permacomputing #666cpu #uxn
2022-03-28T22:38:14+01:00	twtxting from my old laptop! stuck in bed with a nasty back pain, trying to come up with a small fun project to take my mind off it
2022-04-04T00:51:16+01:00	next step for https://git.sr.ht/~noizhardware/666cpu/tree/master/item/vm/666MR will be Kur, a new virtual computer system with a variable length audio buffer, let's see how it plays out #666cpu #nyx #coding #sound
2022-04-07T23:30:51+01:00	lolol actually, I'm now building a quick'n'dirty repl in C to test some mechanics, ended up implementing a small VM, adding sound asap, let's see where that leads me #crow #raven #lang #coding #sound #livecoding #nyx
2022-04-12T23:01:22+01:00	I present you klebe https://git.sr.ht/~noizhardware/klebe a small library to connect programs, has a common device memory and an audio process, no need for midi, osc, tdp, just throw bytes around!!
2022-04-15T12:20:58+01:00	twtxting from a train, that's a first :))
2022-04-27T14:05:00+01:00	just learnt about VT100 escape codes. The most minimalist-direct way to make TUIs :)) #coding #tui
2022-05-06T00:24:51+01:00	trying some day planning on paper, quantizing all tasks into pomodoros. feels good. my goal is to make software only if/when I'll feel I'll need it and have a pretty decent idea of WHAT I need #tracking #selfimprovement #time
2022-05-09T19:02:59+01:00	LoL I just added a REPL to my 'simple & minimal' cli pomodoro timer #coding #tool #util #lang
2022-05-10T21:43:13+01:00	I was reading something to make a little pause from work. I saw a gnat on the screen. I thought 'wow imagine how's it perceiving the screen-space world'. So I went on and browsed Shadertoy for an hour LoL #shader #visual #trip #psychedelic #coding
2022-06-01T20:44:41+01:00	on my workbench I have 3x raspberryPis, an Arduino Micro, 2 full breadboards, a screen, a box of PIR sensors, 100mt of phone cable, and it's for a job. I'm happy.
2022-06-12T21:58:03+01:00	@<kubikpixel https://thunix.net/~kubikpixel/twtxt.txt> hellooo!!!! \\o//
2022-06-24T18:20:42+01:00	in the [[gameoflife]] there are 8 cells around each cell, that can be 0 or 1. Make #sound with that. #8bit or even #1bit with bitscan. Maybe on #uxn . #halfbaked #coding #cellularautomata
2022-08-18T21:24:42+01:00	dreaming of exotic APUs
2022-08-23T13:44:48+01:00	#TIR (Today I Realized): typical human hands count in base eleven, as two closed fists can represent zero, so a good single-digit representation could be a [0..A] range #math
2022-08-24T22:20:23+01:00	started writing a small crawler to find keywords and mentions, should now be able to see if you're mentioning me :)) #twtxt #community #coding
