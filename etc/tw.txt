2022-03-20T16:40:09+01:00	hello twtxt!!! tweeting with https://git.sr.ht/~noizhardware/twBao, still a work in progress :))
2022-03-20T22:50:19+01:00	now twtxting from my netbook, on Lubuntu uiiii it works!
2022-03-21T00:15:18+01:00	will have to implement some curl scanning for follows and mentions. gona be a nice chance to brush up my C-string-fu LoL
2022-03-21T11:40:51+01:00	funny how a stack-based machine might actually be a welcoming environment for functional reactive programming #frp #coding #raven #666cpu
2022-03-21T20:39:14+01:00	LWave : system to generate a 1bit or 8bit audio stream with L-Systems (might have an interactive/livecoding part) #sound #coding #livecoding #1bit #nyx #halfbaked
2022-03-22T00:54:15+01:00	twtxting from Android(Termux) uiiiiii!
2022-03-22T09:52:33+01:00	started adding follows, decided to keep my list in the header here, hope it helps with discoverability and making new connections :)) #twtxt #community
2022-03-22T15:34:38+01:00	idea: using a #matrixmixer to generate feedback exciting membranes with a piezo. Try an irish drum #minijack #video #sound
2022-03-25T13:07:36+01:00	#live #music idea: revived devices used as instruments, #sound coming from their own speakers. #livecoding #permacomputing #666cpu #uxn
2022-03-28T22:38:14+01:00	twtxting from my old laptop! stuck in bed with a nasty back pain, trying to come up with a small fun project to take my mind off it
2022-04-04T00:51:16+01:00	next step for https://git.sr.ht/~noizhardware/666cpu/tree/master/item/vm/666MR will be Kur, a new virtual computer system with a variable length audio buffer, let's see how it plays out #666cpu #nyx #coding #sound
2022-04-07T23:30:51+01:00	lolol actually, I'm now building a quick'n'dirty repl in C to test some mechanics, ended up implementing a small VM, adding sound asap, let's see where that leads me #crow #raven #lang #coding #sound #livecoding #nyx
2022-04-12T23:01:22+01:00	I present you klebe https://git.sr.ht/~noizhardware/klebe a small library to connect programs, has a common device memory and an audio process, no need for midi, osc, tdp, just throw bytes around!!
2022-04-15T12:20:58+01:00	twtxting from a train, that's a first :))
