2022-03-20T16:40:09+01:00	hello twtxt!!! tweeting with https://git.sr.ht/~noizhardware/twBao, still a work in progress :))
2022-03-20T22:50:19+01:00	now twtxting from my netbook, on Lubuntu uiiii it works!
2022-03-21T00:15:18+01:00	will have to implement some curl scanning for follows and mentions. gona be a nice chance to brush up my C-string-fu LoL
2022-03-21T11:40:51+01:00	funny how a stack-based machine might actually be a welcoming environment for functional reactive programming #frp #coding #raven #666cpu
2022-03-21T20:39:14+01:00	LWave : system to generate a #1bit or #8bit audio stream with L-Systems (might have an interactive/livecoding part) #sound #coding #livecoding #nyx #halfbaked
2022-03-22T00:54:15+01:00	twtxting from Android(Termux) uiiiiii!
2022-03-22T09:52:33+01:00	started adding follows, decided to keep my list in the header here, hope it helps with discoverability and making new connections :)) #twtxt #community
2022-03-22T15:34:38+01:00	idea: using a #matrixmixer to generate feedback exciting membranes with a piezo. Try an irish drum #minijack #video #sound
2022-03-25T13:07:36+01:00	#live #music idea: revived devices used as instruments, #sound coming from their own speakers. #livecoding #permacomputing #666cpu #uxn
2022-03-28T22:38:14+01:00	twtxting from my old laptop! stuck in bed with a nasty back pain, trying to come up with a small fun project to take my mind off it
2022-04-04T00:51:16+01:00	next step for https://git.sr.ht/~noizhardware/666cpu/tree/master/item/vm/666MR will be Kur, a new virtual computer system with a variable length audio buffer, let's see how it plays out #666cpu #nyx #coding #sound
2022-04-07T23:30:51+01:00	lolol actually, I'm now building a quick'n'dirty repl in C to test some mechanics, ended up implementing a small VM, adding sound asap, let's see where that leads me #crow #raven #lang #coding #sound #livecoding #nyx
2022-04-12T23:01:22+01:00	I present you klebe https://git.sr.ht/~noizhardware/klebe a small library to connect programs, has a common device memory and an audio process, no need for midi, osc, tdp, just throw bytes around!!
2022-04-15T12:20:58+01:00	twtxting from a train, that's a first :))
2022-04-27T14:05:00+01:00	just learnt about VT100 escape codes. The most minimalist-direct way to make TUIs :)) #coding #tui
2022-05-06T00:24:51+01:00	trying some day planning on paper, quantizing all tasks into pomodoros. feels good. my goal is to make software only if/when I'll feel I'll need it and have a pretty decent idea of WHAT I need #tracking #selfimprovement #time
2022-05-09T19:02:59+01:00	LoL I just added a REPL to my 'simple & minimal' cli pomodoro timer #coding #tool #util #lang
2022-05-10T21:43:13+01:00	I was reading something to make a little pause from work. I saw a gnat on the screen. I thought 'wow imagine how's it perceiving the screen-space world'. So I went on and browsed Shadertoy for an hour LoL #shader #visual #trip #psychedelic #coding
2022-06-01T20:44:41+01:00	on my workbench I have 3x raspberryPis, an Arduino Micro, 2 full breadboards, a screen, a box of PIR sensors, 100mt of phone cable, and it's for a job. I'm happy.
2022-06-12T21:58:03+01:00	@<kubikpixel https://thunix.net/~kubikpixel/twtxt.txt> hellooo!!!! \\o//
2022-06-24T18:20:42+01:00	in the [[gameoflife]] there are 8 cells around each cell, that can be 0 or 1. Make #sound with that. #8bit or even #1bit with bitscan. Maybe on #uxn . #halfbaked #coding #cellularautomata
2022-08-18T21:24:42+01:00	dreaming of exotic APUs
2022-08-23T13:44:48+01:00	#TIR (Today I Realized): typical human hands count in base eleven, as two closed fists can represent zero, so a good single-digit representation could be a [0..A] range #math
2022-08-24T22:20:23+01:00	started writing a small crawler to find keywords and mentions, should now be able to see if you're mentioning me :)) #twtxt #community #coding
2022-08-25T12:55:12+01:00	#test from p2 phone ૮ ˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶ ა
2022-08-25T22:25:05+01:00	looking at my crawler's log scrolling on the screen, randomly copying feeds with an interesting-looking name into my browser. what a nice way to discover new things #twtxt
2022-08-27T14:07:21+01:00	pondering about the difference between my use of the tags #idea and #halfbaked . halfbaked looks like something in a more advanced stage, merely lacking execution #meta
2022-09-06T16:30:20+01:00	just had an MRI scan, rekindled my enthusiasm for #music , fragmented arrangement ideas #noise #idm #experimental
2022-09-11T20:49:33+01:00	sound-only pong: pitch, panning and volume should be enough #halfbaked #videogame #sound #coding #nyx #klebe
2022-09-11T20:51:24+01:00	sound-only tetris: chords and layered timbres come to mind, might yield pretty interesting tunes :)) #halfbaked #videogame #sound #coding #nyx #klebe
2022-09-13T22:44:45+01:00	pirate radio stations from another dimension #trip #sound
2022-09-21T10:54:52+01:00	#TIL pencil writing is more permanent and waterproof than most ink. good news, I love pencils! #eco #notes
2022-09-21T17:56:48+01:00	analog circuit debugging is a transcendental experience. every.single.time. #electronics
2022-09-25T13:34:08+01:00	M DISC media has a projected lifetime of several hundred years. interesting. #permacomputing #hardware
2022-09-27T19:38:59+01:00	I feel that cyberpunk direct man-machine connection I've always thought wonders about, might just be.. #sound . it's a deep, almost unfiltered connection to the subconscious
2022-09-30T12:57:36+01:00	just wrote a note in my code `float* output; /* to write output to physical device, or just the next lower device in the abstraction tower */` feeling pretty proud of that LoL #coding #klebe
2022-10-22T10:53:56+01:00	the first bar in space should be called The 0x20
2022-11-11T19:16:56+01:00	WTFM : Write The Fucking Manual, a note to self. #coding #lol
2022-12-08T22:25:52+01:00	tonight's treat: roasted peanuts, ginger soda and some #ada #coding , with a side of HPC rabbithole
2022-12-12T18:37:21+01:00	updated kalk, a minimal CLI RPN calculator with some extra quirky fuctionality. Pretty happy with its current status https://git.sr.ht/~noizhardware/kalk
2023-02-06T16:56:20+01:00	sloooowly recovering from burnout, more like dragging my knuckles in lukewarm ashes
2023-02-06T17:03:46+01:00	@<pbatch https://pbat.ch/twtxt.txt> not sure you're reading this, how come you're ditching twtxt?

2025-02-20T10:23:30+01:00	oh cool @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> !! and thanks, got rid of that empty line. ATM I'm using twtxt very much in an experimental way, only manual editing or writing my tools. curious to see how it will evolve. #meta #twtxt
